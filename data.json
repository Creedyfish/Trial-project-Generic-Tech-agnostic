Pat it dry with paper towels. </li><li>Cut the salmon into four equal pieces. Tear a stalk of scallion into smaller pieces and scatter them on the steaming plate.

Set aside.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><span class=\"ql-size-large\">Step 3 - Prep Sauce</span></p><p><br></p><ul><li>In a small bowl, combine the light soy sauce (1 tbsp), dark soy sauce (1 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), cooking wine (1 tbsp), white pepper (0.25 tsp) and sugar (0.50 tsp) and mix thoroughly.
